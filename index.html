        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I come from a small town community in The Northern part of California, in the Sierras.</p>
        <p>I currently am attending Indian Valley Academy (High School) with 80 students, a larger number of people than the town itself. My father owns a tech company he built
        from the ground up 12 years back to make the chamber of commerce relevant in the 21st century. He has made it prosper in ways that many would have never thought possible
        for the chamber community. I love learning and trying new levels of skills achivable with technology, and hope to use this degree to furthur achieve product.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal in such a place as this is to one day be able to design and expand my business idea to network the communities together into somthing tangible.
        I would love to learn more and study the following languages of code:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With each one of these languages under my belt, I believe I may be able to produce some exciting works in the future.</p>
        <h3>Practice makes perfect!</h3>
